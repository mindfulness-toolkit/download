<h2>Bring on the Calm!</h2>
<p><strong>Working for the Federal Government can be stressful.</strong> What makes it so challenging? The mission-driven nature of many federal positions can add stress and anxiety to federal roles. The very nature of some roles such as air traffic control, overseas assignments, and border control have stressful aspects built right in.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates these issues.</strong> According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, nearly half of all Americans report that the Coronavirus crisis is impacting their mental health. While most federal employees are full-time teleworking, in many cases they are trying to balance simultaneous work, caregiving, and children’s at-home learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness can help!</strong></p>
<p>Federal government employees want resources to help them cope, even thrive, amidst these challenging times, but they are largely absent. In its first-ever Work-Life survey, conducted in 2017, The Federal Government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) reported that while 30% of federal employees surveyed desired stress management programming from their agency, only 3% reported access to this programming.&nbsp;</p>
