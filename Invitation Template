Good afternoon everyone, 
 
It is my pleasure to share an opportunity to participate in a mindfulness journey developed as a project for the Excellence in Government Fellows program. A team of federal employees participating in the program developed a Mindfulness Toolkit to share with Federal Agencies and the public.
 
Numerous studies point to the benefits of a mindfulness practice, including improved concentration, reduced perceived stress and anxiety, and reduced burnout and depression. It can also help increase emotional intelligence, improve relationships, and improve work performance. 
 
The Mindfulness Toolkit leverages a free mobile mindfulness app developed by the Veterans Administration and offers a 30-day Mindfulness Journey with activities to try, and free government-sponsored mindfulness resources. 
 
This is a great opportunity for those new to mindfulness and for those who already practice. It only takes a few minutes each day to develop this healthy habit.
